# 1. Insert a new Node at the head of the Single Linked List
Inserts a new element as the first element of the list. As head node always points to the first element of the list, insertion at head means that we are inserting the first element in the list.

## Time Complexity

O(1)

# 2. Insert a new Node at the end  of the Single Linked List
insert at the end of a linked list
## Time Complexity
This algorithm traverses the entire linked list, and hence, works in O(n) time.

# 3. Insertion in Singly Linked List (Insert After)
Sample Input #
linkedlist = 0->1->2->3->4 <br/>
data = 8
previous = 2 <br/>
Sample Output #<br/>
linkedlist = 0->1->2->8->3->

# 4. Search in Singly Linked List
boolean searchNode(T data)<br/>
Sample Input #
linkedlist = 5->90->10->4   and  value = 4 <br/>
Sample Output #<br/>
true

## Time Complexity #
The time complexity for this algorithm is O(n) because we have to traverse through the list.
