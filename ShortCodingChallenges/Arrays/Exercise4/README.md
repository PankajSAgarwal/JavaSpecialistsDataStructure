# Problem Statement
In this problem, you have to implement the int[] findProduct(int[] arr) function which will modify the whole array in such a way that each index will have a product of all numbers present in the array (except the number stored on the current index)

## Function Prototype #
int[] findProduct(int[] arr)

## Sample Input #
arr = {1,2,3,4}

##Sample Output #
arr = {24,12,8,6}

## Time and Space Complexity
Time Complexity	O(n)
Space Complexity	O(n)
Auxiliary Space Used	O(1)
