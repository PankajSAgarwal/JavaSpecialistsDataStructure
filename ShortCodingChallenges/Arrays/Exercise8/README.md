#Problem Statement -  Right Rotate the Array by One Index
Given an array, can you rotate its elements once from right to left?

## function prototype
void rotateArray(int[] arr)

## Sample input

arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}


## Sample output

arr = {5, 1, 2, 3, 4}

## Time Complexity

Since the entire array is iterated over once, the time complexity of this solution is O(n).
