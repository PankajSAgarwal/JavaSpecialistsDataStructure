To rotate the array towards the right, we have to shift the array one index position towards the right.
This means moving every element from index i to i + 1 position.
However, if we start shifting elements then the last element at index arr[arr.length - 1] is overwritten.
Hence first we save the element in a variable lastElement. Then we start shifting elements from index i - 1 to i
where i starts from the last index i.e. arr.length - 1. When the loop ends value in lastElement is placed on arr[0].
