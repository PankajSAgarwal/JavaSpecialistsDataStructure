# Merge Two Sorted Arrays
## Problem Statement
In this problem, given two sorted arrays, you have to implement the int[] mergeArrays(int[] arr1, int[] arr2) function which returns an array consisting of all elements of both arrays in a sorted way.

## Sample Input 
arr1 = {1, 3, 4, 5}  
arr2 = {2, 6, 7, 8}

## Sample Output

arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

# Time Complexity 
The time complexity for this algorithm is O(n+m) where n and m are the sizes of the arrays. This is because both arrays are iterated over once.
