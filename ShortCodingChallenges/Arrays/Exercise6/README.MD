# PROBLEM STATEMENT

Given an array, find the first integer which is unique in the array. Unique means the number does not repeat and appears only once in the whole array

## Function Prototype #
   int findFirstUnique(int[] arr)

## Sample Input #
   arr = {9, 2, 3, 2, 6, 6}
##  Sample Output #
   9

## Time Complexity #
   The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2)
   â€‹since the entire list is iterated for each element.

# Note
The solution provided above is not the optimal solution for this problem. 
A more efficient approach is to use hashing instead
